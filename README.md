Bale Collage Bot is a Python-based bot designed for Bale Messenger, allowing users to send three photos
and receive a single, professionally formatted collage in return.The bot features:
  - Asynchronous handling of incoming messages using python-bale-bot.
  - Vertical collage layout with consistent width and preserved aspect ratios.
  - White borders and spacing between and around photos for a polished, clean look.
  - User-friendly interactions, including a /reset command to start over.
  - Fully in-memory processing (no temporary files needed) for speed and efficiency.

This project is ideal as a demonstration of messaging bot development, image processing with Python (Pillow),
and asynchronous programming in real-world applications.
